Dr. Zhang is a Research Scientist at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center, where she works in the AI department, more specifically in the area of physical science and analytics. She works on the core of an IBM product called [PAIRS](https://www.ibm.com/us-en/marketplace/geospatial-big-data-analytics) -- Physical Analytics Integrated data Repository and Services.

Her expertise lies in Deep Learning in remote sensing data, time series analysis/forecast, big data platform for spatial and temporal data, and dsitribubted training for large scale Deep Learning models. In her PhD, she did advanced large scale adaptive meshing algorithms for Computation Fluid Dynamics simulations, and energy simulation for buildings.
